* pdf2txt: content is (cid:4193) (cid:3944)
* info in meta should be separated into different parts:
  - basic: md5sum, size
  - changed frequently: filepath and filename
  - tricky to get: pdf meta
* support multi format: chm, doc, text
* maintain book files in repo
* fix: pdf2txt may hang forever
* refactor: split item from repo
* find similar/duplicated book by content
* web page text overlap
* setup ftp for uploading
* check duplicated files(if fingerprint is the same, need check content md5)
* pagination
* show search info. example: About 2,760,000,000 results (0.22 seconds)
